# 🚀 Maven Insiders - Netlify Deployment Guide

## ⚡ INSTANT DEPLOYMENT (Recommended - No Git Required)

Since you're experiencing Git/build issues, here's the **fastest way** to deploy:

### Option 1: Manual File Upload (100% Success Rate)

1. **Your files are already built!** ✅

   ```
   dist/spa/ folder contains:
   - index.html (618B)
   - assets/index-CVQG2etR.css (62KB)
   - assets/index-77NChkSo.js (582KB)
   - favicon.ico, robots.txt
   ```

2. **Zip the dist/spa folder**

   - Right-click `dist/spa` folder → "Compress to ZIP"
   - Or use: `zip -r maven-insiders.zip dist/spa`

3. **Deploy instantly:**
   - Go to [netlify.com/drop](https://netlify.com/drop)
   - Drag the ZIP file (or just the dist/spa folder)
   - **Your site will be LIVE in 30 seconds!** 🎉

## 🔧 Git Deployment Troubleshooting

If you want to use Git deployment later, here are the fixes:

### Fix 1: Repository Root Structure

Make sure your repository has this structure:

```
repository-root/
├── package.json          ← Must be in root
├── netlify.toml          ← Must be in root
├── client/
├── server/
├── dist/
└── node_modules/
```

### Fix 2: Alternative netlify.toml Configurations

**Option A: Basic Config**

```toml
[build]
  command = "npm install && npm run build:client"
  publish = "dist/spa"
```

**Option B: With Node Version**

```toml
[build]
  command = "npm ci && npm run build:client"
  publish = "dist/spa"

[build.environment]
  NODE_VERSION = "18"
```

**Option C: Step-by-step Commands**

```toml
[build]
  command = "npm ci && npm run typecheck && npm run build:client"
  publish = "dist/spa"
```

### Fix 3: Manual Repository Setup

1. **Create a fresh repository:**

   ```bash
   # Create new repo on GitHub
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Maven Insiders cannabis portal"
   git branch -M main
   git remote add origin YOUR_REPO_URL
   git push -u origin main
   ```

2. **In Netlify Dashboard:**
   - "New site from Git"
   - Connect GitHub
   - Select your repository
   - **Manual build settings:**
     - Build command: `npm install && npm run build:client`
     - Publish directory: `dist/spa`
